      "\n",
      "#### Required Changes\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Memory Deallocation Safety**:\n",
      "   - Ensure that memory deallocation and unmapping are performed safely to prevent potential memory leaks or undefined behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Code Safety**:\n",
      "   - Add checks for null pointers before dereferencing them to avoid potential crashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Thread Safety**:\n",
      "   - Ensure that the function is thread-safe if it can be called from multiple threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Function Documentation**:\n",
      "   - Document the function properly to explain what it does, its parameters, and its return value.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consistency**:\n",
      "   - Ensure the code follows consistent coding standards, such as naming conventions and indentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Simplify Code**:\n",
      "   - Simplify the while loop condition for better readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logging**:\n",
      "   - Improve the logging statement to be more consistent and informative. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
      "   - Add error handling to manage cases where `MmUnmapIoSpace` or `MmFreeNonCachedMemory` might fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Commenting**:\n",
      "   - Add comments to explain the purpose of each operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Code Readability**:\n",
