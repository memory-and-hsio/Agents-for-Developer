      "### Code Review Comments\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Required Changes\n",
      "1. **Parameter Validation**: The validation for `speed` should be done at the start of the function to avoid unnecessary calculations if the input is invalid.\n",
      "2. **Exception Handling**: The current exception handling is too generic. It should be more specific to catch particular exceptions and handle them accordingly.\n",
      "3. **Magic Numbers**: Use named constants instead of magic numbers for readability and maintainability.\n",
      "4. **Logging**: Replace `std::cout` and `std::cerr` with a proper logging mechanism.\n",
      "5. **Consistency**: Ensure consistent use of types (UINT32, UINT16, etc.) and naming conventions.\n",
      "6. **Avoid Duplicate Error Messages**: The default case in the switch statement should not reach the point where it prints another invalid speed error message.\n",
      "7. **Return Early**: Use early return to simplify the logic and reduce nesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Suggestions\n",
      "1. **Function Decomposition**: Consider splitting the function into smaller, more manageable functions.\n",
      "2. **Use Enums**: Define an enum for the link speeds to improve readability.\n",
      "3. **Documentation**: Add comments to explain the purpose and usage of each part of the code.\n",
